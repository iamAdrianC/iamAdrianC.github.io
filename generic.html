									<h1>Hello!<br />
									My name is Adrian</h1>
									<p>Familiarizing myself in data analysis by working on projects and improving my skills.</p>
								</header>
								
								<p>Thank you for taking the time and taking a look at my portfolio for data analysis.  The projects demonstrate basic understanding and concepts through the use of Excel, SQL, Python and R.</p>
									<p>I am currently a behavior therapist for special needs students.  It is meaningful work that I do in order to help students fulfill a meaningful life.  Everyday I study human behavior and observe what motivates a person for a reward.  With my position, I have sought opportunities to grow my experience and develop my skills as a therapist by working with different kids, age groups and schools.  With my six years of experience, I was able to cultivate a safe environment for the students to learn with help and guidance from school staff and supervisors.  I firmly believe it takes a great support team to improve the lives of special needs students.</p>
								<p>With my current experience as a behavior therapist, I am confident that my unique perspective and experience is vital to a team’s success in the field of data analysis.  All of us make conscious choices in life and we need to understand why.  Data and analyzing trends on how people make decisions is important in helping drive a company’s success.  With the coordination and guidance of a data analysis team and my insights on human behavior, I can be valuable in learning and achieving team goals to better serve and improve the lives of others.
